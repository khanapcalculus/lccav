# Workflow Status Update

## Good News! 

I can see in your GitHub Actions:
- ✅ **"pages build and deployment"** - **SUCCESS** (green checkmark)
- ❌ **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** - Failed (red X)

## What This Means

The **built-in GitHub Pages deployment succeeded!** This means your site should already be live at:
**https://khanapcalculus.github.io/lccav**

## About the Two Workflows

1. **"pages build and deployment"** (✅ Success)
   - This is GitHub's automatic Pages deployment
   - It runs when you enable Pages in settings
   - This one is working!

2. **"Deploy to GitHub Pages"** (❌ Failed)
   - This is our custom workflow
   - We can fix it or just use the built-in one

## Next Steps

1. **Try your site**: https://khanapcalculus.github.io/lccav
   - It should be working!

2. **If you want to fix the custom workflow**:
   - Click on the failed workflow to see the error
   - Share the error message and I'll fix it

3. **Or just use the built-in deployment**:
   - It's already working!
   - You can disable our custom workflow if you prefer
