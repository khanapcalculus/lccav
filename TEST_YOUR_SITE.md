# Test Your Site Now!

## ✅ Workflow #7 Succeeded!

The deployment workflow completed successfully. Your React app should now be in the `docs` folder.

## Steps to Test

### Step 1: Verify Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/khanapcalculus/lccav/settings/pages
2. Make sure it shows:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `gh-pages`
   - Folder: `/docs`
3. If not, update and save

### Step 2: Wait for Pages to Update
- GitHub Pages can take 1-2 minutes to update after deployment
- Even though workflow completed, wait a bit for Pages to refresh

### Step 3: Test Your Site
1. Visit: **https://khanapcalculus.github.io/lccav**
2. **Hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Or try **Incognito/Private mode** to avoid cache

### Step 4: What You Should See
- ✅ **Join Room screen** with:
  - "LCCAV Video Call" heading
  - Room ID input field
  - Your Name input field
  - "Join Room" button
- ❌ **NOT** the README.md content

## If Still Showing README

1. **Clear browser cache completely**
2. **Try different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
3. **Wait 2-3 more minutes** - Pages might need more time
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors

## Success Indicators

- You see the "Join Room" interface
- You can enter a room ID and name
- The page looks like a modern web app, not a markdown document

Your React app should be live now! 🎉
